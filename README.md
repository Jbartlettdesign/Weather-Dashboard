# Weather-Dashboard
This app uses third-party APIs allow to allow users to access their data and functionality to view current location weather.
This weather dashboard runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
Use the OpenWeather One Call API and Google Maps Geocoder to retrieve weather data for cities. 
I've also used localStorage to store any persistent data from previous searches.
